## Description <a name="description"></a>
Horiseon is the first weekly challenge of many in my Coding Bootcamp and is meant to simulate an on-the-job ticket scenario where I am given the task of refactoring existing code.
The final website can be viewed at [https://ijacksondesign.github.io/Horiseon/](https://ijacksondesign.github.io/Horiseon/)

## The Challenge <a name="challenge"></a>
Horiseon is a digital marketing agency looking to update their existing website code to follow accessibility standards so that their website is optimized for search engines.

## The Criteria <a name="criteria"></a>
1. HTML file has semantic elements
1. HTML file follows a logical structure
1. Images have accessible alt attributes
1. CSS file has been consolidated and redunt code has been removed
1. Both the HTML and CSS files have proper comments to quickly understand what the code is doing

## The Method <a name="method"></a>
1. **Step 1:** Looking at the provided mockup, I took out a pen and paper and made my own sketch, labeling the different elements so that I would already have an idea of what the structure should be before even viewing the code. 

1. **Step 2:** Next I opened the HTML file and did a quick run through and made comments throughout that labeled the different parts of the file so that whenever someone viewed the code it was easy to tell what was where. 

1. **Step 3:** Then I ran through the CSS file making comments and taking note of areaswhere code could be consolidated. 

1. **Step 4:** Began the process of tweaking the code. 
    1. Swapped out divs for more descriptive elements such as header, footer, nav, section, article, and aside. 
    1. Added alt and title attributes where applicable to describe images
    1. Replaced multiple styles with universal styles to get rid of repetive CSS code

## Final Result <a name="results"></a>
After refactoring, Horiseon's website still looks and functions the same, but if one was to view their code they would find it to be more accessibility not just for other developers but for search engines and screen readers as well. 

The files now follow semantic elements giving better description to the various sections along with several comments dictating where sections begin and end. 

## Reflection <a name="reflection"></a>
I think this project was a good example of being able to accomplish a task in multiple ways. While the original code still worked and functioned fine, there were still ways that it was able to be improved upon. 

Sitting down and breaking down the site before jumping into the code really helped give me an idea of how the site should be structed so that when I actually viewed the code I was able to quickly point out these areas of improvement.
